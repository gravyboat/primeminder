Primeminder
===========

Primeminderis designd as a very simple statit HTML one page application
where users can sign up for a mailing list as well as a section for how users
can support the application financially. It also includes
legal/privacy policy content. This site uses Bootstrap 4, and is 100%
mobile device compliant. Amazon affiliate links, mailing list URLS, and Amazon
OneLink items have been removed and will need to be replaced if you want to
use this application. The HTML uses a heavily modified and stripped down
version of [Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/).

Screenshots

down for the support section, legal and privacy screenshots are not included
as those are just text)

How to set up the project
-------------------------

This project is a simple static site so set up is easy. You can either clone
it and set things up yourself, or take a look at my
[primeminder-salt](https://github.com/gravyboat/primeminder-salt) which uses
SaltStack to configure and deploy everything.
